# Winningtemp - Frontend test

Code and solution by Dawid Kaleta.

## How to test it / start the application

### T1 (HTML + CSS)

Should work to open the index.html in most modern browsers

### T2 (React.js)

1. When in the directory of T2 you need to install all dependencies with the command "npm install" in your console (assuming Node.js is installed on the system).
2. Then, to start the application locally you need to enter "npm start" in the console.
